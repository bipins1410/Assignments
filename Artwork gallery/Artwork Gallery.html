<td>The world’s most famous artwork, the Mona Lisa draws thousands of visitors to the Louvre Museum each day,<br> 
    many of whom are compelled by the sitter’s mysterious gaze and enigmatic smile. The seemingly ordinary <br> portrait 
    of a young woman dressed modestly in a thin veil, somber colors, and no jewelry might also confound its <br> viewers,
    who may wonder what all the fuss is about. The painting’s simplicity belies Leonardo’s talent for realism. <br>
    The subject’s softly modeled face shows his skillful handling of sfumato, an artistic technique that uses subtle 
    gradations <br> of light and shadow, rather than line, to model form. The delicately painted veil, the finely wrought 
    tresses, and the <br> careful rendering of folded fabric reveal Leonardo’s tireless patience in recreating his studied 
    observations.

<br>
<td>One of the most famous paintings in the world, the Last Supper was commissioned by Ludovico Sforza, duke of  
    Milan and <br> Leonardo’s patron during his first stay in that city, for the Dominican monastery of Santa Maria 
    delle Grazie. Depicting a <br> sequential narrative, Leonardo illustrates several closely connected moments in the 
    Gospels, including Matthew 26:21–28, <br> in which Jesus declares that one of the Apostles will betray him and then 
    institutes the Eucharist. Leonardo, who was intrigued <br> by the manner in which a man’s character can reveal itself 
    in posture, expression, and gesture, depicted each disciple’s unique <br> reaction to the declaration. The Apostles’ 
    postures rise, fall, extend, and intertwine as they appear to whisper, yell, grieve, <br> and debate around Jesus, 
    who sits serenely in the center.

    </th>
    <br>
    <br>
<img src="Vitruvian-Man.webp" align="left" width="300" height="200">
<br>
<td>Leonardo’s pen-and-ink drawing Vitruvian Man comes from one of the many notebooks that he kept on hand during 
    his mature years. <br> It is accompanied by notes, written in mirror script, on the ideal human proportions that the 
    Roman architect Vitruvius laid out in a <br> book on architecture from the 1st century BCE. The drawing illustrates 
    Vitruvius’s theory that the ideal human could fit within a <br> circle and a square, two irreconcilable shapes. 
    Leonardo resolved the concept by drawing a male figure in two superimposed <br> positions—one with his arms outstretched 
    to fit in a square and another with his legs and arms spread in a circle. The work shows <br> not only Leonardo’s effort 
    to understand significant texts but also his desire to expand on them. He was not the first to illustrate <br>
    Vitruvius’s concepts, but his drawing later became the most iconic, partly because its combination of mathematics, 
    philosophy, <br> and art seemed a fitting symbol of the Renaissance. The drawing is now housed in the Gallerie dell’
    Accademia, Venice, where <br> it is not typically on display but kept in a climate-controlled archive.

    <br>
<img src="Self-portrait.webp" align="left" width="300" height="180">
<br>
<br>
<td>Long regarded as a self-portrait, the red chalk drawing of an old man with long wavy hair and a beard has 
    been reproduced to <br> such an extent that it defines how most people think of Leonardo’s appearance. Yet some 
    scholars argue that the figure, with its <br> craggy features, furrowed brow, and downcast eyes, appears much older 
    than the age Leonardo ever reached; Leonardo died <br> at age 67. They propose that the drawing may be one of his 
    grotesque drawings, sketches he habitually made in his notebooks <br> of people with eccentric features. Whomever 
    the portrait represents, it is a departure from Leonardo’s often captivating subjects, <br> yet he managed to imbue 
    the figure with the nobility and wisdom of a mature age.

<img src="Virgin-of-the-Rocks.webp" align="left" width="300" height="150">
<br>
<br>
<td>Based on stylistic evidence, many scholars consider the painting The Virgin of the Rocks in the Louvre the 
    first of two paintings <br> that Leonard made of an apocryphal legend in which the Holy Family meets Saint John 
    the Baptist as they flee to Egypt from Herod’s <br> Massacre of the Innocents. Leonardo was involved in years of 
    litigation with the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception, which <br> commissioned the work, and the dispute
    eventually led Leonardo to paint another version of the subject about 1508, which is now <br> housed in the National 
    Gallery of London.

    <br>
    <br>
<img src="Head-Woman.webp" align="left" width="300" height="150">
<br>
<td>Head of a Woman, a small brush drawing with pigment, depicts a young woman with her head tilted and her 
    eyes downcast. <br> Her posture recalls the Virgin Mary in Leonardo’s The Virgin of the Rocks, suggesting that
     the drawing may have served as a <br> model. The drawing’s nickname, La scapigliata, translates to “disheveled”
      and refers to the young woman’s wayward strands <br> of hair. The loosely sketched tendrils and shoulders
       contrast with the highly finished face, where Leonardo gently modeled the <br> woman’s delicate features,
        from her heavy eyelids to her tender lips. It reveals Leonardo’s fluid means of working, utilizing both <br>
         expressive drawing to create form and controlled layering to provide detail.

    <br>
<img src="Lady-Ermine.webp" align="left" width="300" height="150">
<br>
<td>Many art historians identify the youthful woman in Lady with an Ermine as Cecilia Gallerani, the 
    mistress of Leonardo’s patron, <br> Ludovico Sforza, duke of Milan. The ermine was often used as an emblem for
    the duke. The woman turns her head to the right, her <br> bright eyes seemingly directed toward something outside
    the frame. Although the painting has been heavily overpainted, notably <br> the dark background, it nonetheless
    reveals Leonardo’s knowledge of anatomy and his ability to represent character in posture and <br> expression.
    He captures the girl’s youth and genial nature in her guileless features, attentive gaze, and tender embrace
    of the ermine, <br> which sits with its head cocked regally and alert. Her slender hand reveals the complicated
    bone structure beneath the skin, just as the <br> head of the ermine suggests the skull underneath the finely
    rendered fur.

<img src="Salvator-Mundi.webp" align="left" width="300" height="170">
<br>
<td>The head-on portrait of Salvator Mundi (c. 1500; “Savior of the World”) made headlines in 2017 when it sold
    for a record-breaking <br> $450.3 million at auction. The high price was all the more surprising when considering 
    that Salvator Mundi was in poor condition, <br> it had a questionable history, and its attribution was a subject 
    of debate among scholars and critics. Many pundits remarked on the <br> poor skill used to represent Jesus’ face; 
    the stiff posture, which was so unlike the Renaissance master’s characteristic twisting poses; <br> and the 
    unconvincing representation of the glass globe, which, if solid, would have reflected a distorted view of 
    its holder, an optical <br> trick that Leonardo would have known about. Christie’s, the auction house that managed 
    the sale, dismissed the criticisms, noting <br> that any lack of craft was the result of heavy restoration in 
    previous centuries and pointed to the soft modeling of Jesus’ right hand <br> and the finesse of his tight curls, 
    both characteristics that resembled Leonardo’s technique.
