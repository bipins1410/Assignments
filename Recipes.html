<h2 align="center">2. Chocolate Coated Peanut Butter Crackers </h2>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
<li>¾ cup creamy or chunky peanut butter</li>
<li>2 pounds chocolate almond bark, broken into pieces</li>
<li>80 buttery round crackers (such as Ritz®)</li>
<li>2 ¼ ounces colored candy sprinkles (Optional)</li>
</ul>
            
<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Spread approximately 1 teaspoon peanut butter onto each cracker half. Press peanut butter sides together to 
    form 40 peanut butter-filled sandwich cookies.</li>
<li>Melt almond bark in the top of a double boiler over hot, but not boiling, water. Reduce heat and keep melted 
    chocolate in top of double boiler over simmering water.</li>
<li>Dip each sandwich cookie into the melted chocolate, allowing excess to drain back into pot.</li>
<li>Place coated cookies onto waxed paper and immediately sprinkle with candy sprinkles so they adhere to the 
    melted chocolate.</li>
<li>Place cookies in the refrigerator until chocolate has set, about 15 minutes.</li>

<h3>Tips:</h3>
<p> You can substitute vanilla-flavored candy coating for the chocolate almond bark, and decorate with any type of 
    candy coatings instead of sprinkles.</p>
