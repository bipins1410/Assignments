<h3>What is cancer?</h3>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<backquote>Cancer is when cells in the body change and grow out of control. Your body is made up of tiny building 
    blocks called cells. <br> Normal cells grow when your body needs them, and die when your body does not need them any 
    longer. <br> Cancer is made up of abnormal cells that grow even though your body does not need them. In most types of 
    cancer, the abnormal cells grow to form a lump or mass called a tumor.</backquote>

<h3>What causes cancer?</h3>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<backquote>Two types of factors contribute to the cause of cancer. One is a tendency or predisposition to 
    develop cancer. <br> The other is exposure to the triggers that start it off. Examples are cigarettes, environmental 
    toxins, sun exposure, or liver damage.</backquote>

<h3>Are chemicals and pollutants causing cancer?</h3>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<backquote>In a very small portion of special cases only. In certain jobs, prolonged exposure to a few chemicals 
    may cause certain rare kinds of cancers. <br> Nowadays almost all of these substances have been identified and are 
    regulated.</backquote>

<h3>Does cigarette smoke really cause cancer?</h3>

<h3>Can attitudes or stress cause cancer?</h3>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<backquote>Not as far as researchers know. In fact, the idea that the cancer “personality” or a bad attitude 
    contributes to the cause of cancer may be part of the ancient human habit of blaming the patient for the disease.

    <h3>Will my hair grow back?</h3>
    <h3>Answer</h3>
    <backquote>Yes, hair loss from chemotherapy is temporary. It will grow back, usually after therapy is finished. 
        In some cases, hair can grow back during therapy. <br> Usually the texture of the hair is different for the first 
        year. Then, after a year or so, it usually goes back to how it was before you took chemotherapy. <br> Hair loss 
        from radiation therapy may be irreversible.
