<th align="center"> 1) C & C++</th>
<td align="center"> 1985</td>
<td>C is probably the oldest and popular programming language and is the root of other programming languages 
    such as C#, Java, and JavaScript. C++ is an enhanced version of C. Many developers today skip learning C on 
    its own, while others think learning C first provides a valuable foundation for C++ development. Both languages 
    are widely used in computer science and programming. C and C++ developers can make use of compilers for a wide v
    ariety of platforms, making applications developed in these languages largely transportable. Both C and C++ are 
    considered high-performance languages.

<th align="center"> 2) PHP</th>
<td align="center">1990</td>
<td>PHP is an open-source programming language created in 1990. Many web developers find it essential to 
    learn PHP, as this language is used to build more than 80% of websites on the Internet, including 
    notable sites like Facebook and Yahoo. Programmers mainly use PHP mainly to write server-side scripts. 
    But developers can also use this language to write command-line scripts, and programmers with high-level 
    PHP coding skills can also use it to develop desktop applications.

<th align="center"> 3) Python</th>
<td align="center">1991</td>
<td>Python is one of the most popular programming languages today and is easy for beginners to learn because 
    of its readability. It is a free, open-source programming language with extensive support modules and 
    community development, easy integration with web services, user-friendly data structures, and GUI-based 
    desktop applications. It is a popular programming language for machine learning and deep learning applications.
    Python is used to develop 2D imaging and 3D animation packages like Blender, Inkscape, and Autodesk.

<th align="center"> 4) Java</th>
<td align="center">1995</td>
<td> Java is one of the most popular programming languages used today. Owned by Oracle Corporation, this 
    general-purpose programming language with its object-oriented structure has become a standard for 
    applications that can be used regardless of platform (e.g., Mac, Windows, Android, iOS, etc.) because 
    of its Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) capabilities. As a result, Java is recognized for its portability 
    across platforms, from mainframe data centers to smartphones. Today there are more than 3 billion devices 
    running applications built with Java.

<tr>
<th align="center"> 5) Javascript </th>
<td align="center"> 1995</td>
<td> Javascript was created in 1995 and was initially known as LiveScript. However, Java was a very popular 
    language at that time, so it was advertised as a “younger brother” of Java. As it evolved over time, 
    JavaScript became a fully independent language. Nowadays, JavaScript is often confused with Java, and 
    although there are some similarities between them, the two languages are distinct.
    JavaScript is a high-level programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. 
    It is used as a client-side programming language by 97.8 percent of all websites. JavaScript was originally 
    used only to develop web browsers, but they are now used for server-side website deployments and non-web 
    browser applications as well.
